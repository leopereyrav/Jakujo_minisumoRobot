# Jakujo_minisumoRobot
Jakujo is the first robot that I built and programmed in the year 2015. It is a minisumo robot that participated in a competition within my university and got the second place.

For the creation of this robot, I researched many minisumo robot competitions to extract the best features of the winners and adapt them in my design.
